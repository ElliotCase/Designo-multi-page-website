# Using the design files

In this download, we provide both Sketch and Figma versions of the design. This means you can choose which design tool you prefer to use. You can also import the Sketch file into Adobe XD, if you prefer to use that. We provide information on how to do this below.

Using these design files will help you practice building projects in the same way professionals do. Seeing the details in the design will help you improve your accuracy when building projects and build projects faster.
 
## Sketch

[Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) is a popular design tool, but it requires a license and macOS in order to use it. If you've got both, the Sketch file will be a great option for you.

## Figma

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is another extremely popular design tool that has a generous free tier and can also be used on both Windows and Mac computers.

To get started with Figma, [download the correct app for your operating system](https://www.figma.com/downloads/). You can then open the app and open the `.fig` design file by dragging it over the app and dropping it into the projects home screen.

If you're going to use the Desktop App, you don't need to download the Font Installer from the downloads page. But if you're planning on using the Figma web app you should download and install it to ensure the fonts show up correctly.

If you haven't used Figma before, we strongly recommend reading this [“Everything Developers Need To Know About Figma” article on Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/09/figma-developers-guide/) to help you get up to speed.

## Adobe XD

We don't include XD files in the download, but if you want to use it you can import the Sketch file into Adobe XD very easily. 

It's worth noting that there can be rendering issues when importing Sketch files into XD, so we strongly recommend using either Sketch or Figma to view the designs.

If you do want to get started with XD though, [head over to the downloads page and choose the free version](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/xd/pricing/individual.html). Once you’ve downloaded and opened the app, go to File > Open from Your Computer and then find the challenge Sketch file on your computer and open it up. Once that’s done, you’ll be able to dive into the design on Adobe XD!

We hope you enjoy the challenge! 🙂
